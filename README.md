# Data Analytics Portfolio
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Ian and I'm an aspiring Data Analyst/Data Scientist from Taiwan. While pursuing a degree in Business Administration at USC, I took an interest in Applied Data Analytics and Machine Learning in a business setting, propelling me on this exciting path. I love being able to tell meaningful and impactful stories through the use of data, and have been building up my skillset to make it possible. This online portfolio includes some of my personal projects where I collect and explore data that are of personal interest.
