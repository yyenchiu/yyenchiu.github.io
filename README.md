## Introduction
Hello! My name is Ian and I'm an aspiring Data Analyst/Data Scientist from Taiwan. While pursuing a degree in Business Administration at USC, I took an interest in Applied Data Analytics and Machine Learning in a business setting, propelling me on this exciting path.

This online portfolio includes some of my personal projects where I collect and explore data that are of personal interest.
