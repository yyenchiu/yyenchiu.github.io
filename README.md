# Data Analytics Portfolio
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Ian and I'm an aspiring Data Analyst/Data Scientist from Taiwan. While pursuing a degree in Business Administration at USC, I took an interest in Applied Data Analytics and Machine Learning in a business setting, propelling me on this exciting path. I love being able to tell meaningful and impactful stories through the use of data, and have been building up my skillset to make it possible. This online portfolio includes some of my personal projects where I collect and explore data that are of personal interest.

你好，我叫做邱育彥，目前打算在台灣作為數據分析師發展。大學雖然就讀企管系，但是因個人興趣而接觸統計，商用數據分析，以及商用機器學習。我以能有效的用數據說故事為目標來學習。以下有我的幾個個人作品。
Note: 作品目前沒有翻譯成中文版本請見諒

### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, NoSQL, R, Tableau, RapidMiner, MATLAB

## Projects
### Los Angeles City Crime Analysis
This is one of my first full data analytics personal projects. Having spent around 3 years calling LA my home (unfortunately COVID-19 stole a year), I've gotten a good glimpse of the good and the bad that the city has to offer, and it's inspired me to do a deep dive into LA's records of criminal activity and public safety.

### USA Urban Crime Analysis
Following my exploration of crime in LA, I thought it would be interesting to expand the scale and look at crime and safety in the cities of America. The results have been turned into a dashboard that you can use to compare the crime level and relevant statistics between different cities. It should be an intuitive dashboard that utilizes city names and years to navigate, and you can clik on the cities displayed in the various graphs to get basic information about their crime levels.

### League of Legends Professional Gameplay Meta Analysis
This is a personal project I started because I am a long-time fan of the popular video game League of Legends (started playing since I was in 5th grade!). While I am not a very good player by any metric, I enjoy thinking about "the meta", which is basically which champions are currently the best to play. Some of my favourite champions never make it to the professional meta, which made me wonder why certain champions are better suited for professional play than others. I decided to gather all the available data on professional tournaments and conduct an analysis on the changes in professional meta as a starting point to this question.
