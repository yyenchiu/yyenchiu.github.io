# Data Analytics Portfolio
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Ian and I'm an aspiring Data Analyst/Data Scientist from Taiwan. While pursuing a degree in Business Administration at USC, I took an interest in Applied Data Analytics and Machine Learning in a business setting, propelling me on this exciting path. I love being able to tell meaningful and impactful stories through the use of data, and have been building up my skillset to make it possible. This online portfolio includes some of my personal projects where I collect and explore data that are of personal interest.

你好，我叫做邱育彥，目前打算在台灣作為數據分析師發展。大學雖然就讀企管系，但是因個人興趣而接觸統計，商用數據分析，以及商用機器學習。我以能有效的用數據說故事為目標來學習。以下有我的幾個個人作品。
Note: 作品目前沒有翻譯成中文版本請見諒

### Technical Skills/硬技術: Python, SQL, NoSQL, R, Tableau, RapidMiner, MATLAB

## Projects/作品
### Los Angeles City Crime Analysis/洛杉磯犯罪率分析報告
This is one of my first full data analytics personal projects. Having spent around 3 years calling LA my home (unfortunately COVID-19 stole a year), I've gotten a good glimpse of the good and the bad that the city has to offer, and it's inspired me to do a deep dive into LA's records of criminal activity and public safety using historical crimd data provided by the LAPD. Note: For now, the dashboard linked below only contains arrest data from 2018-2023 (instead of arrest and incident report data from 2010-2023) because the dataset had to be reduced to meet online hosting standards.

这是我完成的第一份完整的数据分析个人作品。經過大學期間在洛杉矶生活了三年多的時間，我对这座城市的好坏有了深刻的了解。洛杉磯市一座極為區域化的城市，居民普遍認為不同的地區雖然距離很近但是犯罪率以及安全程度都會有極大的變化。為了證實這些“感覺”，我利用洛杉磯警局十幾年來提供的犯罪資料來深入研究洛杉矶的犯罪活动以及公共安全。Note: 原版的 Dashboard 採用了 2010-2023 的數據，但為了減輕容量上的負擔，這個版本只能看到部分的資料(2018-2023)。

### USA Urban Crime Analysis/美國都市犯罪率分析報告
Following my exploration of crime in LA, I thought it would be interesting to expand the scale and look at crime and safety in the cities of America. The results have been turned into a dashboard that you can use to compare the crime level and relevant statistics between different cities. It should be an intuitive dashboard that utilizes city names and years to navigate, and you can click on the cities displayed in the various graphs to get basic information about their crime levels.

在我對洛杉磯的犯罪率進行分析之后，我對美国各城市的犯罪率和安全情况產生興趣，認為可以将研究规模扩大。研究结果已经制作成一个仪表板，您可以使用它来比较不同城市之间的犯罪水平和相关统计数据。这個仪表板操作簡單易懂，主要利用城市名称和年份进行导航。您可以点击图表中显示的城市，获取有关其犯罪水平的基本信息。

### League of Legends Professional Gameplay Meta Analysis/英雄聯盟職業
This is a personal project I started because I am a long-time fan of the popular video game League of Legends (started playing since I was in 5th grade!). While I am not a very good player by any metric, I enjoy thinking about "the meta", which is basically which champions are currently the best to play. Some of my favourite champions never make it to the professional meta, which made me wonder why certain champions are better suited for professional play than others. I decided to gather all the available data on professional tournaments and conduct an analysis on the changes in professional meta as a starting point to this question.

因为我是《英雄联盟》这款热门游戏的长期粉丝（从五年级开始玩的！），所以選擇以此做為個人研究分析的題材之一。虽然我不是一个很优秀的玩家，但我喜欢思考遊戲的趨勢——也就是目前哪些英雄或是套路最強勢。我從以前就發現自己最喜欢的一些英雄从未进入职业趨勢，所以想知道为什么某些英雄更适合职业比赛。我决定從網上收集所有关于职业比赛的可用数据，并对职业趨勢的变化进行分析，作为回答这个问题的起点。
